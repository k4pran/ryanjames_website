        In this tutorial series I will be discussing git and github. The goal of these tutorials is to give
        a well-rounded introduction to git and get you to a level where you understand it well enough to handle
        most situations. It will not be comprehensive, however it will begin with the basics and delve a little
        into intermediate git.
    </p><br>

    <p class="article_content_block_paragraph">
        Let's jump in with the question - <i>what is git?</i><br>
        Git was developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds and is an application used for <b>version control</b>. To understand
        git you need to understand version control and what problem it solves.
    </p><br>

    <h5 class="article_sub_heading">Version Control</h5><br>
    <p class="article_content_block_paragraph">
        Version control is a system that allows you to track documents over time. It can track changes, hold old versions,
        allow your project to split into different paths (called branches) and much more. It has very widespread usage
        in software development, however it is also used in other domains such as writing laws, film editing, book publishing etc.
        If you use a text editor that allows you to roll back your changed to an early version, that is another example
        of version control. In the context of writing code, it is extremely useful for a number of reasons. Imaging you
        get your program working, but then make a few tweaks which breaks everything. You may want to roll back to an
        early version. This is only one of many features git (and other version control) has, so let's return back to
        focus on git now that we have an idea of what version control is.
    </p><br>

    <h5 class="article_sub_heading">What can git do</h5><br>
    <p class="article_content_block_paragraph">
        As we mentioned, git tracks changes in your code along with the date/time of these changes. These changes are
        saved and logged using a command called <b>commit</b>. You change your code then <i>commit</i> these changes. If
        you do not like these changes or something goes wrong you always have the option to roll back to an earlier
        version. Commits often include a message with them. The message consists of a short summary of what changes you
        made to a given file or files. This is also extremely useful for yourself and others to look back at all the changes
        made to understand why these changes were made and what they were trying to accomplish.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Git can also have multiple <b>branches</b>. You can think of branches as different paths your code can takes.
        You will always have at least one branch and the main branch is known as the <b>master</b> branch. An example of
        how branches could be used goes like this. Imaging you are working on a project such as a calculator. You have
        arrived at a point where you may want the calculator to display previous calculations to the user for consecutive
        calculations such as how google's calculator does. Instead of commiting to going this single direction you could
        create a separate branch and work on this feature. You now have two branches. The master branch and the newly created
        one that you named "history_tracker" or something useful. You can decide at some point whether to discard this
        branch, keep it as an alternative branch for later use or to <b>merge</b> it with the master branch if you decide
        this is a feature you want as a part of your calculator project.
    </p><br>
    <p><br>
        Git makes it easier to manage work across multiple devices and across multiple developers by using certain
        commands such as <b>push</b> which sends local changes to update a branch or <b>pull</b> which pulls changes
        from a remote location to a local machine. Many developers can work on the same projects and be pushing, pulling,
        merging branches, committing changes etc and git helps make managing all of this much easier.
    </p>
    <p><br>
        There are many other features, however we will discuss these as we go along.
    </p>
    <h5 class="article_sub_heading">Git vs Github</h5><br>
    <p class="article_content_block_paragraph">
        The title of this series is git AND github. We have only been discussing git as it can be easy to confuse the two.
        Git is an application with a commandline interface (CLI). Github is a website that facilitates version control
        using git. It offers the functionality that git offers along with some extra features such as issue tracking.
        They are not the same thing but it helps to think of github as a web service built on top of git and it offers
        a user-friendly interface for version control.
    </p><br>
    <p class="article_content_block_paragraph">
        Creating an account at github is free and you do not need git installed. Simply visit
        <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> and sign up. There is a demo on creating your first project to help
        you get started. Projects are called <b>repositories</b> or "repos" and in github they can be public or private.
        You may be limited to the number of private ones you can have for free.
    </p>
    <h5 class="article_conclusion_heading">Conclusion</h5><br>
    <p class="article_content_block_paragraph">
        This was a short introduction to git to help you understand what it is and why we use it. Git is an application
        using a commandline interface that offers version control over your documents. Github is a web-based service
        that uses git's features along with a few extra ones to give you control when managing your "repos" and
        makes collaboration easier.
