        This introduction to a-frame will be a brief overview of what a-frame is and what you can do with it. It will
        be the first in a series of posts that will include tutorials on how to use it and looking under the hood to
        gain a better understand of a-frame.

    <p class="article_content_block_paragraph">
        A-frame is a framework for creating virtual reality (VR) experiences. The term a-frame is used in construction
        to bear a heavy load in a lightweight manner. A-frame does this as you can create VR experiences using html and
        so you can use any IDE that supports html, or even develop using a simple text editor. Continuing the a-frame
        construction analogy it leverages <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> to render 3d graphics and is built
        on top of <a href="https://webvr.info/">webvr</a> to handle lower level VR tasks such as communicating with
        virtual reality headsets and devices. A-frame abstracts lower level graphics with three.js and lower level VR
        jobs with webvr and so it is a good idea to take a step back and look at what three.js and webvr. We will
        being by looking at webvr.

    <p class="article_content_block_paragraph">
        WebVR is an API written in javascript to provide support for a range of virtual reality devices. It is able to
        detect the headsets, figure out what the headsets can do and allow developers to communicate with the devices
        via javascript. It can for example provide position, orientation, FOV, display info and much more. The API also
        includes a low-level API for interfacing with gamepads and an API that extends the gamepad API for more advanced
        gamepads. An example is the oculus touch controllers. WebVR provides mappings to the controller to allow
        developers to listen for click events or thumbstick movements. Position, orientation, vibration, haptics and
        other advanced features are provided in the gamepad extensions API. It also renders the controller in VR so you can
        see the controller in the VR environment or hands or whatever 3d model you want to replace the controller.

    <p class="article_content_block_paragraph">
        WebVR is still very new and has limited support across browsers. It originated with mozilla and so naturally firefox
        is supported and is probably the best browser to use to get started. Chrome for android also offers support and
        it would be worth while checking back occasionally as other browsers may follow suit.

    <h4 class="article_sub_heading">ThreeJS in Brief</h4>
    <p class="article_content_block_paragraph">
        Now onto three.js that provides a-frame with a 3d rendering library. A-frame is built on top of three.js and exposes
        its' underlying functionality. A lot of this functionality can be accessed using a-frame's html tags. An example
        is using the html tag &lt;a-box&gt;
    </p>

    <pre class="article_content_block_paragraph collapsible"><code class="language-html">
        &lt;a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9" shadow&gt;&lt;/a-box&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p class="article_content_block_paragraph">
        You can see the example above uses A-frame to create a cube. It exposes three's BoxGeometry class. Also notice
        that you are not writing any javascript here, only html, but can still access properties such as position in
        the Object3D class (which is a base class for most 3D objects) using html attributes. Some of the base A-frame
        tags map directly to a three.js class:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;a-scene&gt;&lt;/a-scene&gt; maps to a three.js scene</li>
        <li>&lt;a-entity&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt; maps to a three.js object</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="article_content_block_paragraph">
        The relationship between a-frame and three.js is a close one and you have full access to three.js through a-frame.
        You will eventually begin using javascript once you need to move beyond the basics and create custom objects or
        'entities' in a-frame terminology. The whole three.js framework is stored as a global object 'THREE' and so you
        literally have the whole library at your fingertips.
    </p>

    <p class="article_content_block_paragraph">
        Now that we have talked briefly about the relationship between a-frame and three.js it is worth focusing more on
        what exactly three.js is. In its' own words <br><br>
        "<i>Three.js is a lightweight cross-browser JavaScript library/API used to create and display animated 3D
        computer graphics on a Web browser. Three.js scripts may be used in conjunction with the HTML5 canvas element,
        SVG or WebGL.</i>"<br><br>
