        Every day we use numbers. So much so that it may seem that that way we count to 10 is the only way to count to 10.
        Think about the numbers we use to represent quantities of 'stuff'

        <em>0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9</em>

        These are 10 symbols that really have nothing to do with the quantities they represent. They are simply ten distinct
        symbols that we all agree on in the same way we agree on what words in our vocabulary represent. We could have chose completely
        different symbols as numbers instead. This may seem a little obvious but the next point is not so obvious to most.
    </p>
    <p>
        The less obvious point is that not only are the symbols arbitrary, but the number of symbols we use to represent
        numbers is also arbitrary. The most common numerical system used today is called decimal and it consists of the
        symbols 0-9. There is really no reason why we should use 10 distinct symbols. We could have used 5 symbols, 8 symbols or
        32 symbols in our numerical system. It is useful to have only 10 symbols as we have 8 fingers and 2 thumbs to count
        with, however there are cases where the decimal system - also known as <em>base-10</em> is not the ideal choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this exploration of different numerical systems used commonly (and sometimes less commonly) in technology we
        will cover different 'bases', such as base-2, base-8 and base-16. We will discuss a little of their history, what
        their use cases are and also talk about how to convert values between these different systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's get aquainted with the names of these number systems.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Binary</em> - A base-2 system consisting only of 0 and 1</li>
        <li><em>Octal</em> - A base-8 system consisting of numbers 0-7</li>
        <li><em>Hexidecimal</em> - A base-16 system consisting of all decimal numbers 0-9 and letters A-F</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When I began learning this hexidecimal took me by surprise as it is isn't intuitive to think of the letters A-F
        as numbers, but remember they are only symbols and can represent whatever we agree on and in hexidecimal we have
        agreed that 0-9 represents 0-9 as in decimal, however when we add one more on, instead of going into double digits
        with 10, in hexidecimal 'A' represents 10. Don't worry if you don't get this at first, you will soon enough.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use the same words for numbers no matter what base we use so 'A' in hexidecimal is still called 'ten'. Think of
        what happens when you round of of 'symbols' counting up to 10. 0, 1, 2 ..., 8, 9, <b>10</b>. Once you get to 10
        you put a 1 in front and then start back to 0 on the second digit and carry on. This idea works the same for other
        bases also. In hexidecimal for example once you reach 'F' (the highest digit) you put a 1 in front and begin counting
        10, 11, 12 ..., 1D, 1E, 1F then 20, 21 ..., 2F etc. This can be confusing as 10 in hexidecimal isn't the same as
        10 in decimal and instead is actually 16 in decimal. We will talk later how to convert between the different bases.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are going to begin with the smallest base and the one the is most associated with computers - <b>binary</b>.
        Binary consists of only two digits - 0 and 1. Binary is the language of computers and the reason for this is
        because of the circuitry used to build them. Computers consist of transisters which you can think of as a switch
        that is either on or off. On and off are two states and so base-2 is a perfect fit to represent these two states.
        The 1 in binary can be used to represent the
